# WordEntropy
How many words can you find before entropy hits

In a random characters grid, find as many words as you can.

To change any character, find other characters where the range in the alphabet between them contains the character you want.

They will then become the same character.

For example:
```
lgaxep
```
You can swap l,p and x for m and form the word game.

```
mgamem
```
